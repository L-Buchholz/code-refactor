# Code Refactor

A digital marketing agency ("Horiseon") needed an accessibility update to the code for its webpage. The following objectives ("Acceptance criteria") were requested and have now been implemented:

- Source code features semantic HTML elements
- HTML elements follow a logical structure (independent of styling and positioning)
- All icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The title element is concise and descriptive

Additionally, all HTML and CSS code was cleaned and consolidated (where necessary), and comments were added to the CSS file. The webpage links were also proofed so that they now function properly.

## Final webpage

The following is an image of the webpage, highlighting its appearance and functionality:
